# Regex-Lex-Codes

Lex is a programming tool used for lexical analysis, which is the process of converting a sequence of characters (input) into a sequence of tokens.
It is commonly used in compilers and interpreters to break down source code into meaningful components like keywords, operators, and identifiers.
The tokens produced by Lex are fed into the parser (often generated by tools like Yacc or Bison) to analyze the syntactic structure of the code.
